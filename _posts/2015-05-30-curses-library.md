This talk revolves around the curses library, specifically the ncurses library. Ncurses, or
new curses, is a library that is used to make graphics user interfaces, or GUIs, using the
C language. The GUIs are text based, and though they might look ancient, can actually be
fairly complex and run on machines that might not have a way of displaying windows. 

A big question you are probably asking is why would I want to you use this? This library
seems difficult to use and not worth my time seeing as it doesn't supply me with the power
to create a beautiful GUI. In my opinion, it is always to look at how computing was done in
the past to gain an appreciation for the technologies now, and of course it looks really cool!
During this talk I will show you how to use the curses library and make a simple game with
it. From there you are free to use your knowledge to create a more complex game, like 
Dwarf Fortress or Rogue!
