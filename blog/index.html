	Welcome to my tech talks area! Below are a list of topics in Computer Science that I discuss. Each Tech Talk is
	different and is meant to be an exploration into a topic I find interesting. The topics can range from the simple
	to the complex, from technologies to code. Some of the talks will contain code that will be contained within a
	Github repository shared amongst all talks. Enjoy!
