	<h1>My Resume</h1>

	<h2>School Record</h2>
	<p>
		B.S. in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a
		GPA of 3.9
	</p>
	
	<h2>Google Software Intern (Summer 2014)</h2>
	<p>
		I worked on testing infrastructure for the Android hardware graphics
		pipeline. I developed a framework that allows developers internally and
		externally to test various drawing routines in software and hardware,
		and compare results using different methods that I had implemented.
	</p>

	<h2>Research and Development Intern at Manhattan Associates (Summer 2013)</h2>
	<p>
		I worked with another intern on porting over a Perl application into
		Java that used XML data to create a database schema. The tool was a step
		towards a continuous integration structure at Manhattan Associates and
		it was meant to be a tool that allowed a developer to easily recreate
		a database and populate it with data between tests.
	</p>

	<h2>Discrete Math Teacher's Assistant (Fall 2013 - Spring 2015)</h2>
	<p>
		I assisted with the teaching of Discrete Mathematics under Instructer
		Monica Sweat at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Myself along with
		another TA taught an hour and a half class each week for around fifty 
		students. I regularly graded papers each week and administered tests
		with other TAs for class sizes of up to 200 students.
	</p>

	<h2>Georgia Tech Resident Advisor (Fall 2013 - Spring 2015)</h2>
	<p>
		I oversaw forty freshmen each year as a Peer Leader, a Resident Advisor
		specifically over freshmen at Georgia Tech. My main responsibilities
		included keeping order within the residence hall, as well as building a
		strong and supportive community for all of those on my hall. I regularly
		held floor meetings, dinners, and events meant to increase the
		camaraderie amongst the men on my hall. Periodically I had duty which
		required me to respond to any emergencies for a specific time period,
		either twelve or twenty-four hours, which could range from a resident
		locked out of their room, or a fire in a kitchen.
