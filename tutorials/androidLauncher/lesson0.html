<p> Lesson number 0 - Getting Started</p>

<p> 
	For this lesson I will be covering basic details about how to create a
	project and how exactly we will be displaying all of the applications a user
	has installed. I recommend the use of Android Studio when doing an Android
	application, as it is very useful at speeding up the development process of 
	any app. By searching on Google for Android Studio you should find plenty of
	resources on how exactly you can install Android Studio for your respective
	platform.
</p>

<p> 
	Once you have Android Studio, or your development platform that you prefer,
	installed, we are going to want to create the basic application just to get
	a simple baseline. We are going to want to target an SDK that allows the
	most of users access to our technology, so I prefer at the time of writing
	this piece to target SDK version 18, Jelly Bean, this means any SDK version
	from 18 onwards will support our application. Once there we just need to
	make sure no Activity is made for us as we want to do that from scratch
	ourselves. Based on your development environment, there should be some files
	that were automatically created, specifically the Android Manifest file. We
	are going to modify the Manifest to add an Activity that will represent the
	launcher's main screen similar to below.
</p>

<div class="codeSnip">
	<img src="/images/tutorials/customLauncher/lesson0/manifest.png"
		alt="Manifest Code Snip" />
</div>

<p>
	In terms of what was added to the Manifest, the most important things are
	between the activity tags. For the Activity itself, we have four important
	parts. The first thing to notice is the label. The label is the human
	readible name for the application, and this will become very important when
	we go to display the names of all the applications currently on the system.
	Second, our theme is meant to display the application taking up as much room
	on the screen as possible, since it is meant to be driving the user's focus
	to the application that they want to use at the time. Third is the
	launchMode, which in this case is singleTask and it forces the Android
	system to only allow for one instance of this Activity to run at any given
	time. Fourth is stateNotNeeded attribute which is used to signal to the
	Android system whether or not to save information when the Activity is
	killed and restarted, which we set to true in order to ensure that it
	doesn't get removed if it somehow crashes in the future. In between the
	actual activity tags are the intent-filter tags. Inside these
	tags we add to special categories, android.intent.category.HOME and
	android.intent.category.DEFAULT, which signal to the Android operatiing
	system that this activity should be an option when clicking on the Home
	button, thus making it behave like a launcher.
