<p> Lesson number 0 - Getting Started</p>

<p> For this lesson I will be covering basic details about how to create a
	project and how exactly we will be displaying all of the applications a user
	has installed. I recommend the use of Android Studio when doing an Android
	application, as it is very useful at speeding up the development process of 
	any app. By searching on Google for Android Studio you should find plenty of
	resources on how exactly you can install Android Studio for your respective
	platform.
</p>

<p>     Once you have Android Studio, or your development platform that you
prefer,     installed, we are going to want to create the basic application just
to get     a simple baseline. We are going to want to target an SDK that allows
the     most of users access to our technology, so I prefer at the time of
writing     this piece to target SDK version 18, Jelly Bean, this means any SDK
version     from 18 onwards will support our application. Once there we just
need to     make sure no Activity is made for us as we want to do that from
scratch     ourselves. Based on your development environment, there should be
some files     that were automatically created, specifically the Android
Manifest file. We     are going to modify the Manifest to add an Activity that
will represent the     launcher's main screen similar to below. </p>

<div class="codeSnip">
	<p>
		&lt;manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
		    package="acalabrese.com.absolutelauncher"&gt;

		    &lt;application android:allowBackup="true" android:label="@string/app_name"
		        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher" android:theme="@style/AppTheme"&gt;

		        &lt;activity android:name="acalabrese.com.absolutelauncher.LauncherActivity"
		            android:label="Absolute Launcher"
		            android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Wallpaper.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen"
		            android:launchMode="singleTask"
		            android:stateNotNeeded="true"&gt;

		            &lt;intent-filter&gt;
		                &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" /&gt;
		                &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.HOME" /&gt;
		                &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" /&gt;
		            &lt;/intent-filter&gt;

		        &lt;/activity&gt;
		        
		    &lt;/application&gt;

		&lt;/manifest&gt;
