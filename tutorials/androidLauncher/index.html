<p>
	In this tutorial I will be covering the basic concepts behind how an Android
	launcher is made and how you can customize various parts of the launcher to
	your own needs. An Android launcher is, in simple terms, the home screen of
	your Android device. Good examples of various Android launchers include
	Nova Launcher, Action Launcher 3, and the Google Now Launcher. The appeal to
	using an alternate launcher, or building your own, is the ability to
	customize the look and feel of your Android device.

<p>
	The goal of this tutorial is to gain a better insight on how Android
	applications are built from the ground up and to have something useful and
	impressive to show for it at the end. The launcher I will be making is
	pretty basic, but feel free to divert from some of the things done in the
	tutorial and make your launcher your own.
